## Use by website

- **Address:** https://paxyqi.github.io/mahjong/
- **Input attention:** Plz input 14 cards as your hand cards, if you only input 13 cards, we will give you a rand card as _next round_ hand card. If your input cards account is not 13/14, your input will not be calculated.
- **Input demo:**  
  `24m1556p2459s4572z`  
  `6777888p2367s11z` and your hand cards will be look like `🀞🀟🀟🀟🀠🀠🀠🀑🀒🀕🀖🀀🀀🀑(1向聴)`. The far right card `🀑` is the rand one, and it will be different whenever you click the Calc button.
